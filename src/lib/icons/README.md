# Icons

Icons for System should come from TablerIcons.

## Adding a new icon

1. Visit https://tabler.io/icons
2. Find the desired icon
3. Create a new file in this directory named with the "React Name" from Tabler
   **without the `Icon` prefix**, e.g., `BrandMcdonalds.svelte`.
4. Click "Copy SVG" from the Tabler site
5. Paste the SVG into the new svelte file
6. Use the icon in the desired file
